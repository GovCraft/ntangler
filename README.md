   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Govcraft/ntangler.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ntangler
   ```
3. Build and install:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   cargo install --path .
   ```

### Future Availability

In future releases, ntangler will be available through popular package managers for easier installation.

## Configuration

Create a `config.toml` file in the XDG config directory (typically `~/.config/ntangler/config.toml` on Unix-like systems):

```toml
[[repositories]]
path = "/path/to/your/repo"
nickname = "my-project"

[[repositories]]
path = "/path/to/another/repo"
nickname = "another-project"

[[repositories]]
path = "/path/to/another/repo"
nickname = "another-project"
```

Set an $NTANGLER_ENDPOINT environment variable that points to any HTTP server that accepts POST requests with a JSON body containing the diff and returns a JSON response with the commit message structure.

Example JSON response structure:

```json
{
  "commit_type": "feat",
  "scope": "user-auth",
  "description": "add user authentication functionality",
  "body": "Implement JWT-based authentication for user login and registration.\n\n- Add login endpoint\n- Add registration endpoint\n- Implement JWT token generation and validation",
  "is_breaking": false,
  "footers": [
    {"token": "Reviewed-by", "value": "Alice"}
  ],
  "semver_impact": "MINOR"
}
```

For all available options, refer to the [Configuration Guide](https://ntangler.ai/docs/configuration).

## Usage

Once configured, ntangler runs in the background, watching the specified repositories:

1. Start ntangler:
   ```bash
   ntangler
   ```

2. Work on projects as usual, saving files as needed.

3. ntangler automatically generates local commits each time a file is saved.

## Upcoming Features

- Installation from popular package managers.         
- CLI commands for enhanced control and interaction
- Setup wizard for easier initial configuration
- And more!
