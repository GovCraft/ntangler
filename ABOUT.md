# feat(workflow): never write a commit message again

Hey there, fellow coder! I'm Roland, the creator of ntangler, and I've got a story to share with you.

## Why I Built ntangler

For over three decades, I've been in the trenches of software development. From writing code to launching major products for big-name companies, I've worn almost every hat in IT. Most recently, I served as a Principal Technical Lead at a global tech giant known for its e-commerce and cloud services, where I played a key role in shaping the future of the Rust programming language ecosystem.

But here's the thing: throughout my entire career, one frustration has remained constant - the mind-numbing task of writing commit messages.

You know the drill. You're in the zone, cranking out code, solving problems left and right. Then suddenly, you have to stop everything to craft a meaningful commit message. It's like hitting a mental speed bump at 100 mph.

And it's not just me feeling this way.

[Studies have shown](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1054972.1055017) that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds for a developer to get back into the flow after a context switch. That's a huge productivity hit every time you pause to write a commit message.

I've seen this pain point across every team I've worked with, from scrappy startups to tech giants. It's not just about the time wasted; it's about the mental context switch that pulls you out of your flow state.

That's why I created ntangler.

## The Real Cost of Manual Commit Messages

In my years leading development teams, I've seen firsthand how poor commit messages can wreak havoc:

- Countless hours wasted deciphering vague commit histories
- Bugs that took ages to track down due to unclear change documentation
- Painful code reviews that dragged on because the changes weren't well-explained
- Onboarding nightmares for new team members trying to understand the codebase

These aren't just annoyances. They're serious productivity killers that cost companies real money and developers real sanity.

In fact, [a study by Stripe](https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf) found that developers spend about 42% of their time dealing with bad code, which includes time spent figuring out unclear code changes. Imagine how much of that time could be saved with clear, consistent commit messages.

## ntangler: Code at the Speed of Thought

ntangler is my solution to this universal developer headache. It's the tool I wish I had for the past 30 years.

Here's what it does:

1. **AI-Powered Analysis**: It looks at your code changes in real-time, understanding the context and impact of your work.
2. **Automatic Commit Messages**: Generates detailed, conventional commit messages without you lifting a finger.
3. **Seamless Git Integration**: Slides right into your existing workflow - no need to change how you code.
4. **Customizable to Your Style**: Because I know every team has its own flavor of doing things.

## Why ntangler Will Change Your Life (It Changed Mine)

- **Uninterrupted Flow**: Stay in your coding trance. Let the AI handle the documentation. Remember that 23-minute context switch? Gone.
- **Time Saver**: In teams, save hours each week that used to be spent on commit messages. On average, developers make [about 1.5 commits per hour](https://github.blog/2020-12-02-the-state-of-the-octoverse-2020/). Imagine saving even just 5 minutes per commit - that's 60 minutes saved in a typical 8-hour workday!
- **Consistency Across Teams**: No more wildly varying commit styles between developers. Studies show that consistent coding practices can [reduce defects by up to 30%](https://www.it-cisq.org/the-cost-of-poor-software-quality-in-the-us-a-2020-report).
- **Clearer Communication**: Every code change is clearly explained, making reviews and collaboration smoother. Clear communication can [speed up code reviews by up to 20%](https://smartbear.com/resources/ebooks/the-state-of-code-review-2020-report/).
- **Better Code Quality**: When it's this easy to document, developers naturally commit more often, leading to smaller, more focused changes. Smaller, more frequent commits are associated with [up to 45% fewer bugs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-influence-of-organizational-structure-on-software-quality-an-empirical-case-study/).

## Who Needs This? Probably You.

- **Solo Devs**: Spend more time building, less time documenting. The average developer spends [35% of their time managing code](https://www.launchableinc.com/blog/what-is-developer-experience/). Let's cut that down.
- **Development Teams**: Standardize your commits without policing your developers. Teams waste [up to 20 hours a month](https://www.puppet.com/resources/history-of-devops-reports#2020) in meetings discussing coding standards. Automate it instead.
- **Open Source Maintainers**: Make it easier for contributors to provide well-documented PRs. Well-documented projects [attract 60% more contributors](https://github.com/staeiou/github-survey-analysis).
- **Tech Leaders**: Improve your team's productivity and code quality in one fell swoop. Companies report [up to a 40% increase in developer productivity](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/developer-velocity-how-software-excellence-fuels-business-performance) with better tooling.

## Why I'm Building This

I built ntangler because, after 30 years in this industry, I've seen firsthand how much time we waste on tasks that should be automated. Writing commit messages is just one of those tasks, but it's one that impacts us every single day.

This isn't about making a quick buck or creating just another dev tool. It's about giving back to a community that has given me so much over the years. It's about solving a real problem that has frustrated me and countless other developers I've worked with.

I'm not a big company. I'm just a guy who loves coding and wants to make our lives as developers a little bit easier. Every user of ntangler isn't just a statistic to me; you're a fellow developer I'm hoping to help.

My goal is simple: I want ntangler to be the tool I wish I had throughout my career. If it saves you time, reduces your stress, or just makes your day a bit smoother, then I'll consider that a win.

## Ready to Reclaim Your Flow?

Join me in revolutionizing how we document our code. Let's spend less time writing about our code and more time writing actual code.

Stay tuned for installation and usage instructions. And hey, if ntangler makes your day even a little bit better, that'll make my day too.

## Backed by Industry Leaders
I'm thrilled to share that ntangler is a proud participant in Microsoft's Founders Hub startup accelerator program. This partnership not only validates the potential of ntangler but also provides resources and support to make it even better for you. It's a testament to my commitment to innovation and my drive to solve real problems for developers like you.

Let's code smarter, together.
